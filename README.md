NADP_sum: Chemistry data from four northeastern US NADP sites from late 1970's to present (nitrate, sulfate, ammonium, total organic carbon).

Wright_2: Subset of transition states for the Adirondacks - just for visualization

a_spp: Species trait information for just the Adirondack sites.

adk_tile: Subset of transition values for the Adirondacks - just for visualization

alp_cov_matrix1: Matrix of species releative cover values for the Adirondacks.

alp_cov_matrix2: Matrix of species releative cover values for the White Mountains.
